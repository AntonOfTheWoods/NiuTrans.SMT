I) Introduction

NiuTrans is an open-source statistical machine translation system developed by 
the Natural Language Processing Group at Northeastern University, China.
The NiuTrans system is fully developed in C++ language. So it runs fast and uses less memory.
Currently it has already supported phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based and syntax-based models for research-oriented studies.

II) Features

1. Written in C++. So it runs fast.
2. Multi-thread supported
3. Easy-to-use APIs for feature engineering
4. Competitive performance for Chinese-Foreign translation tasks
5. A compact but efficient n-gram language model is embedded. It does not need external support from other softwares (such as SRILM)
6. Supports multiple SMT models
   a) Phrase-based model
   b) Hierarchical phrase-based model
   c) Syntax-based model

III) Requirements

For Windows users, Visual Studio 2008, Cygwin, and perl (version 5.10.0 or higher) are required.
It is suggested to install cygwin under path "C:\" by default. 

For Linux users, gcc (version 4.1.2 or higher), g++ (version 4.1.2 or higher), 
GNU Make (version 3.81 or higher) and perl (version 5.8.8 or higher) are required. 

NOTE: 2GB memory and 10GB disc space is a minimal requirement for running the system.
Of course, more memory and disc space are helpful if the system is trained using large-scale data.
To support large data/model (such as n-gram LM), 64bit OS is recommended.

IV) Installation

Please unpack the downloaded package (surppose that the target directory is "NiuTrans") and follow the following instructions to install the system.

For Windows users, 
   - open "NiuTrans.sln" in "NiuTrans\src\"
   - set configuration mode to "Release"
   - set platform mode to "Win32" (for 32bit OS)
     or
     set platform mode to "x64" (for 64bit OS)
   - build the whole solution
 You will then find that all binaries are generated in "NiuTrans\bin\".

For Linux users, 
   - cd NiuTrans/src/
   - chmod a+x install.sh 
   - ./install.sh -m32 (for 32bit OS)
     or
     ./install.sh (for 64bit OS)
   - source ~/.bashrc
 You will then find that all binaries are generated in "NiuTrans/bin/".

V) Step-by-Step

   a) NiuTrans.Phrase:
      Please refer to the file "NiuTrans/doc/NiuTrans.Phrase.html" to learn how to use the phrase-based engine of the NiuTrans system.

   b) NiuTrans.Hierarchy:
      Please refer to the file "NiuTrans/doc/NiuTrans.Hierarchy.html" to learn how to use the hierarchical phrase-based engine of the NiuTrans system.

   c) NiuTrans.Syntax:
      Please refer to the file "NiuTrans/doc/NiuTrans.Syntax.html" to learn how to use the syntax-based engines of the NiuTrans system.

VI) Manual

We also offer a manual to describe more details about the NiuTrans system, as well as various tricks to build better MT engines.
You can find it under the path "NiuTrans/doc/niutrans-manual.pdf".
